            <h1>THE ART OF A WEBPAGE</h1>
            <p>By Pier Solutions</p>

            <p>Creating a Website for your Business isn't as easy as it seems. As a user, you see some pictures, a navbar, some text and some buttons you can click on. But what goes into creating a basic website, well isn't what most people think it is. A real website designed and developed thoroughly is made up of hard work and talent.</p>
          
            <p>When you go and launch Google, type into your search bar 'Hire Web Developers' you get overloaded with websites that will allow you to drag and drop images and text, or you will get a Web Development company with professional developers and designers. You think to yourself, hmm... let me just see here what I can create myself, and you go into that website, create a free account and a few days later you have a ONE page website.</p>
          
            <p>Well here is where I tell you why that is one of the worst things you can do for online presence and your business. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Hiring A Company</h2>

            <p>So you've decided that you should check out a Website Developers website and you realize what you've missed out on. Hiring a company is more then just the development. It's the service, the experience, the whole journey. You get custom pages, high quality, fast loading, professional sites with professional front-end and back-end development. You don't just get the bare minimum and pay sometimes up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars just for a simple, common template through a regular website builder. I'll say it, it's a SCAM.</p>

            <p>When you look at a website created by a Developer vs a Drag and Drop, you can instantly tell the difference. The Quality, the Time, Effort, Talent. Just everything is better. See for yourself </p>
            
            <h5 class="text-center">Professional</h5>
            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/ps-ss.png" alt="">
            </a>
            
            
            <p></p>

            <h2 class="text-center" >vs</h2>
            
            <p></p>
           
            <h5 class="text-center">Drag and Drop Website Builder</h2>

              <a href="#">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/bsg-ss.png" alt="">
              </a>
          
            <p></p>

            <h1>COSTS</h1>

            <p>With High starting costs per year, Drag and Drop Websites will start you with around $50-$200 per year, not inlcuding transaction fees, ads, support, and any other hidden fees AND domains, your looking at some pretty high yearly costs. Over the course of (ex) 3 years, which will really when your business will have boomed and is growing rapidly, your looking roughly to have paid already in and around $1000.  </p>
          
            <p>Comparing to Developer Companies, you pay from $250-$2000, which seems like a lot, but it really isn't. FOR EXAMPLE, at <a href="index.html">Pier Solutions Development and Design,</a> you get Domain, Ads, Social Branding, Automatic Mailing to Customers, Google Maps, FREE hosting, Free Logo Design, support AND <a href="prices.html">much more</a> for $500-$2000 lifetime costs. Just to compare, if you wanted ALL THAT from a regular Drag and Drop website, you're looking at hundreds of dollars in addons alone, so over a timespan in this case 10 years, you would have saved hundreds if not thousands of dollars by going with a Developer..</p>
            

            <h1>BENEFITS</h1>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/bg-showcase-2.jpg" alt="">
            </a>

            <span class="caption text-muted">High Quality Designs, Development and an overall satisfying experience</span>

            <p>When you hire a company, when you hire a developer, you get high quality, REAL work. Benefits are pretty much endless.</p>

            <p>Benefits include the quality of the work, they have access to high quality images, creating fast pages which is important to a website, it is one of those things that makes or breaks who stays on your page. Realistically, no-one stays on the site for more then 10 seconds if nothing loads. </p>

            <p>More Benefits Include:</p>


            <h5>Saving You time</h5>
            <p>Hiring A Web Designer/Developer will save you hours of tedious work, and it also eliminates customers calling or emailing questions that could and should be answered directly through your website. </p>
            <h5>Positive First Impressions From User</h5>
            <p>When a potential customer decides to Google your business, and your Website pops up and you have a well put together, stunning, professionaly developed Website, it leaves a better impression and increases the chances of customers coming back, buying or even spreading the word about you. </p>
            <h5>Leveraging Social Media To Build Presence</h5>
            <p>When you have a website, you can use it as a hub for all your social media. If someone Googles you, they can now find all your socials, which will increase social traffic, following and overall a better portfolio.</p>
            <h5>Building Demand For Your Business</h5>
            <p>Close to 97% of people Google a business first before they go with one. Having a website will help to generate that level of trust and reassurance that you are professional. They can see your quality of work and will be left with a positive impression.</p>
            <h5>Around The Clock Business Information </h5>
            <p>Having a site or a landing page that customers can quickly get their questions answered about your business, and don't have to wait for a response which takes sometimes days if the business takes a long time. </p>

            <p>These are just a few of the benefits you get when you hire a professional WEB DEVELOPER. You get those extra things that really do matter when you start a business. 30% OF USERS WONT EVEN CONSIDER A BUSINESS IF THEY DONT HAVE A WEBSITE! THATS HUGE! 63 percent of consumers primarily use a company’s website to find and engage with businesses.</p>



            
            <p>It's the small and big things, and anyone who tells you different doesn't know what they're talking about. When you are creating a business, or growing your business, you NEED a website. In today's world, I like to say it's an Industry Standard, so why overpay and get bottom of the barrel content for something that will be the FACE of your online presence.</p>
